**The heart and soul of Neo Atlantis: 33 hand-drawn sketches that tell the story of a dream**

---

## The Story Behind These Sketches

Every great game begins with a pencil and paper. Before a single line of code was written, before any 3D model was created, there were these sketches - drawn in classrooms during breaks, at home late at night, passed between friends in hallways, discussed over lunch at the school cafeteria.

These aren't just drawings. They're the blueprint of a shared dream between a group of teenagers from **IES Lope de Vega** in Spain, who dared to imagine they could create something as ambitious as Final Fantasy VII - armed only with passion, creativity, and whatever free time they could steal from homework and exams.

## The Main Menu Vision

The first impression matters. Here's how they envisioned the game's entry point:

![Main Menu Design](S6plmontana09100713190_0007.jpg)

*The Avalon Interactive logo emerging from stone, menu options carefully planned - every detail considered before implementation.*

---

## Character Designs

### The Heroes

Characters needed to work as tiny sprites while still having personality. Each one was drawn from multiple angles, thinking about how they'd animate in 8 directions:

![Character Model Sheet 1](S6plmontana09100713190_0002.jpg)
![Character Model Sheet 2](S6plmontana09100713190_0003.jpg)

*Front, back, side views - the foundation for sprite animation. Notice the attention to clothing folds and body proportions.*

### Juan - The Protagonist

The main character needed special attention. Here are his movement studies and gameplay notes:

![Juan Movement Studies](S6plmontana09100713190_0029.jpg)

*"Juan cannot leave until he reads the book and talks to his wife..." - gameplay logic written right on the sketch.*

### Gehni - Character Evolution

Some characters were designed to evolve throughout the game:

![Gehni Evolution](S6plmontana09100713190_0030.jpg)

*Two stages of the same character - showing how the story would affect their appearance. The game was planned to span from 1999 to 2028!*

### Afrika

A striking character design by **Estrella M. Cosano Bejarano**, showing two different outfits:

![Afrika - Casual](S6plmontana09100713190_0018.jpg)
![Afrika - Red Cross Uniform](S6plmontana09100713190_0020.jpg)

*The same character in different contexts - casual wear and a Red Cross nurse uniform. The level of detail in clothing and accessories is remarkable.*

### The Mysterious Sorceress

![Sorceress](S6plmontana09100713190_0028.jpg)

*By Irene Golazo - a dark figure with a skull-topped staff, hinting at the mystical elements of the story.*

### The Warrior Goblin

![Goblin Warrior](S6plmontana09100713190_0017.jpg)

*A detailed character design with personality - note the signature at the bottom, a mark of pride in the work.*

### Kresty - The Armored Knight

![Kresty](S6plmontana09100713190_0033.jpg)

*A fully armored warrior with sword and shield - the kind of character that would be a formidable ally or enemy.*

## Enemy Designs - The 2D Design Department

The team had a proper "2D Design Department" (as noted on the sketches), responsible for creating the threats players would face:

### The Robot Army

![Robot Enemies](S6plmontana09100713190_0006.jpg)

*Alpha-Bot, Beta-Bot, Gamma-Bot, Noriega-Bot, X-Bot... A whole taxonomy of mechanical threats, each with unique abilities noted (lasers, fire, metallic spikes).*

### The Alien Invasion

![Alien Enemies](S6plmontana09100713190_0019.jpg)

*Spider Alien, Ghost Alien, Tank Alien, Missile Alien... The variety is impressive - UFOs, humanoids, creatures of all shapes.*

### The MORX Series

![MORX Creatures](S6plmontana09100713190_0021.jpg)

*MORX L-3, L-4, L-5 - increasingly menacing creatures with multiple limbs and aggressive poses.*

### Eye Bot & Canyon

![Eye Bot and Canyon](S6plmontana09100713190_0032.jpg)

*Mechanical enemies with detailed views from multiple angles (front, back, profile) - proper concept art methodology.*

## World Building - The Town of Quorbel

### The Master Plan

Before building anything in 3D, the entire town was mapped out:

![Town Map - Zones](S6plmontana09100713190_0026.jpg)

*North Zone and South Zone clearly marked, with Juan's house, the church, town hall, sex shop, and various businesses. Every building planned.*

![Town Map - North Section](S6plmontana09100713190_0022.jpg)

*Detailed layout of the northern part: bank, lingerie shop, hypermarket, restaurant, mechanic workshop, Civil Guard headquarters...*

### The 3D Reference

And here's how it looked when brought to life in 3D Studio Max:

![3D Town Render](S6plmontana09100713190_0025.jpg)

*From sketch to render - the same town layout now with buildings, trees, and streets. This is what 1999 3D graphics looked like.*

---

## Interior Designs

Every building the player could enter needed a floor plan. The attention to detail is staggering:

### Juan's House

![Juan's House Floor Plans](S6plmontana09100713190_0027.jpg)

*Upper floor and ground floor - notice the carpets ("alfombra"), furniture placement, even the reference to the 3D model file (BARLOURS.MDL).*

### The Hospital

![Hospital Floor Plan](S6plmontana09100713190_0031.jpg)

*Emergency rooms, waiting area, cafeteria, elevators, radiology... A complete medical facility.*

![Hospital Details](S6plmontana09100713190_0012.jpg)

*Another view with consultation rooms, wheelchair access, reception area.*

### Police Station

![Police Station](S6plmontana09100713190_0014.jpg)

*Commissioner's office, armory, multiple offices, a courtyard with a tree and even a cat! The small details make worlds feel alive.*

### Pub Miró

A nightclub with dance floor, designed inside and out:

![Pub Miró Interior](S6plmontana09100713190_0004.jpg)

*The dance floor ("Pista Miró"), DJ booth, bar with stools, seating areas, bathrooms... Everything a virtual nightclub needs.*

![Pub Miró Exterior](S6plmontana09100713190_0005.jpg)

*The street view with the "PUB MIRÓ" sign and parked cars (including what looks like an Avalon company van!).*

### Estilo Burguer Restaurant

![Estilo Burguer](S6plmontana09100713190_0016.jpg)

*A burger joint with complete floor plan - tables, bar stools, even a slide (!) and detailed signage designs.*

### Town Hall (Ayuntamiento)

![Town Hall](S6plmontana09100713190_0024.jpg)

*The civic center with offices, reception, and even an adult shop nearby - the town had everything.*

### Public Restrooms

![Restrooms](S6plmontana09100713190_0008.jpg)

*Yes, even the bathrooms were designed. Men's, women's, and accessible facilities. Nothing was left to chance.*

### Modular Buildings

![Modular Building Plans](S6plmontana09100713190_0009.jpg)
![Modular Building Plans 2](S6plmontana09100713190_0010.jpg)
![Modular Building Plans 3](S6plmontana09100713190_0011.jpg)

*A system of modular rooms that could be combined - smart design thinking for efficient 3D modeling.*

### The Cafeteria

![Cafeteria](S6plmontana09100713190_0013.jpg)

*Tables, chairs, service counter - ready for NPCs to populate.*

### Color Studies

![Color Town Layout](S6plmontana09100713190_0015.jpg)

*One of the few colored sketches - showing the town layout with roads, parking lots, and green spaces.*

## Technical Documentation

Game development isn't just art - it's engineering. These notes show the technical thinking:

![Technical Notes](S6plmontana09100713190_0001.jpg)

*Notes about the library scene: "Shelving in Moray, light wood... books in POV (books.inc)... will be done in Photoshop and Premiere..."*

![Gameplay Variables](S6plmontana09100713190_0023.jpg)

*D = Defense, I = Information, A = Attack, P = Person... The game design document in embryonic form.*

---

## The Five Stages of the Game

Perhaps the most revealing sketch - the complete game structure:

![Game Stages](S6plmontana09100713190_0030.jpg)

**The planned story arc:**
1. **Stage 1** - Beginning / Fight against evil (1999)
2. **Stage 2** - Investigation period / Abandonment of Earth (2028)
3. **Stage 3** - Return and construction of Neo Atlantis / Going for enslaved humans
4. **Stage 4** - Arriving at the planet / Returning with the humans
5. **Stage 5** - God takes them to another place / Fight against extraterrestrials

**THE END**

*An epic scope spanning decades and space travel - ambitious doesn't begin to describe it.*

## A Note on Preservation

These sketches survived 25+ years in a folder, through moves, life changes, and the digital revolution. They were scanned and preserved here not because they're perfect, but because they represent something precious: **the unfiltered creativity of youth**.

Every smudge, every erased line, every margin note is part of the story. Some sketches are clearly from the same hand, others show different artistic styles - evidence of a true collaboration.

The signatures and credits visible on some pages (Estrella M. Cosano Bejarano, Irene Golazo, and the recurring "NanhySoft Team" and "Luilly Entertainment" headers) show that this wasn't just four friends - it was a community effort, with classmates contributing characters and ideas.
