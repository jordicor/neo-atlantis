**Neo Atlantis in action: a visual tour of the game**

---

## Inspired by Final Fantasy VII

These screenshots capture what the team achieved: pre-rendered 3D backgrounds with 2D character sprites, the same technique used by Square's legendary RPG. Every frame represents hours of work in 3D Studio Max, POV-Ray, and DIV Games Studio 2.

The main explorable area of the demo - a small Spanish town rendered in painstaking detail.

## Technical Achievement

What makes these screenshots remarkable isn't just what you see, but how it was made:

- **3D Studio Max** on Pentium II processors
- **Hours of rendering** for each background (sometimes a full day for a single 1024x768 image)
- **No internet** - everything learned from books
- **Collaboration** via floppy disks and phone calls
- **Passion** that kept friends working nights and weekends
